COVID19 India Codes

In this Folder you will find the R MarkDown Files related to the Descriptive Statistics that is done for COVID-19 India Data.

Data has been taken only from "https://api.covid19india.org" for the required analysis.

This is my first attempt to upload the codes to public domain via gitHub Account.
